This code solves the N-Queens problem using a backtracking algorithm. The N-Queens problem is the task of placing N chess queens on an NÃ—N chessboard in such a way that no two queens threaten each other.

Here's an explanation of the code:

1. The `NQueens` class is defined to encapsulate the solving logic for the N-Queens problem. The constructor takes an integer `n` as input, which represents the size of the chessboard.

2. In the constructor, various instance variables are initialized to keep track of the state and solutions of the problem:
   - `self.board` is a 2D list representing the chessboard. Each element is initially set to 0.
   - `self.row`, `self.col`, `self.diag1`, and `self.diag2` are boolean lists used to mark whether a row, column, and two diagonals are occupied or not.
   - `self.solutions` is an empty list to store the found solutions.

3. The `solve` method is used to initiate the solving process. It calls the `solve_helper` method to recursively find all valid solutions.

4. The `solve_helper` method takes a parameter `col` that represents the current column being processed. It uses backtracking to explore different positions for the queen in each column.

5. The base case of the recursive `solve_helper` method is when `col` reaches the maximum number of columns (`self.n`). In this case, a valid solution has been found, and the current state of the chessboard is added to the `self.solutions` list.

6. Inside the `solve_helper` method, a loop iterates over each row in the current column. It checks if the current position is valid for placing a queen by calling the `is_valid` method.

7. If the position is valid, the queen is placed on the chessboard, and the state variables (`self.row`, `self.col`, `self.diag1`, `self.diag2`) are updated accordingly.

8. The `solve_helper` method then recurses to the next column by calling itself with `col + 1`.

9. After the recursive call returns, the queen is removed from the current position (backtracking), and the state variables are reset.

10. The `is_valid` method checks whether a given position is valid for placing a queen. It verifies that no other queen occupies the same row, column, and diagonals.

11. Finally, after the `solve` method is called to find all solutions, the code prints the number of solutions found and displays each solution by iterating over the `solutions` list.

The code essentially utilizes backtracking to systematically explore different configurations of queens on the chessboard. It finds all valid solutions to the N-Queens problem and displays them on the console.
